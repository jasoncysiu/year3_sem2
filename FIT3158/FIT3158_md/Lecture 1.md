# Introduction

▪ We face numerous decisions in life and business. Its not
always easy to make good decision.

- For any given situation there are often numerous possible
    courses of action.
  ▪ Decision analysis
- A means of systematically identifying, evaluating &
  choosing best course of action.
  ▪ We can use computers to analyse the potential outcomes of
  decision alternatives.

# What is Business Analytics?

▪ A field of study that uses computers, statistics, and mathematics
to solve business problems.
▪ Considerable overlap with:

- Operations Research
- Management Science
- Decision Science

```

```

```

```

# A Modelling Approach to Decision Making

▪ A model is

- A structure which has been built purposely to exhibit
    features and characteristics of some other objects
  ▪ Everyone uses models to make decisions
  ▪ Types of models:
- Mental (arranging furniture)
- Visual (blueprints, road maps)
- Physical/Scale (aerodynamics, buildings)
- Mathematical (what we’ll be studying)

```
10
```

# Characteristics of Models

- Usually simplified versions of things they represent
- A valid model accurately represents the relevant
    characteristics of the object or decision problem being
    studied

# A more formal definition

▪ A model is a device which behaves approximately like part
of the real world:

- Train-sets, dolls, toy prams...
- Small aircraft replicas in wind tunnels...
- Sponge-rubber men used in car crash...
- The solar system as a number of small balls moving
    in ellipses round a larger ball...

```
11
```

## Models for Decision Making

May include:
▪ Mathematical equations

- Mathematical Models
  ▪ Structured set of rules or steps to follow
- Algorithms and Discrete Event processes
  ▪ Simulation of real events
- Queuing models, waiting lines
  ▪ Statistical techniques
- Data Analysis, Equation Fitting

```

```

# Modelling: Why bother?

▪ Real Understanding:

- The process may reveal hidden inner relationships within
    the system.
- Formal Analysis (assumptions/relationships)
- Experimentation - can be used repeatedly
- To large extent, independent of the data
- Variety of models for the same problem

```
13
```

```
Relisten the explaination
```

# Benefits of Modelling

▪ Economy

- Less costly to analyze decision problems.
  ▪ Timeliness
- Deliver needed information more quickly than their real-
  world counterparts.
  ▪ Feasibility
- Used to do things that would be impossible in reality.
  ▪ Insight & understanding
- That improves decision making.

```

```

# Advantages of Using Models

▪ Less expensive and disruptive than experimenting with real
world system
▪ Models enable us to ask ‘what if’ questions and test the
sensitivity of particular values
▪ Models force a consistent, systematic approach to a problem
▪ Models require managers to be specific about constraints and
goals
▪ Models can reduce the time taken to make decisions

```
15
```

# Disadvantages of Using Models

▪ May be expensive to develop and test
▪ May be misused and misunderstood because of their
complexity
▪ Models may down play the value of non-quantifiable
information
▪ May oversimplify the variables of the real world

```
16
```

```
(e.g., there may be too much variables)
```

# What is a “Computer Model”?

▪ A set of mathematical relationships and logical assumptions
implemented in a computer as an abstract representation of a
real-world object or phenomenon.
▪ Spreadsheets provide the most convenient way for business
people to build computer models

- Spreadsheets are commonplace on most computers.
- They are the tool of choice for today’s managers.
- They facilitate decision-making process by making it
    easier to play out various what-if scenarios.

```

```

```
= Spreadsheet model
```

# Example of a Mathematical Model

#### Profit = Revenue - Expenses

#### or

#### Profit = f(Revenue, Expenses)

#### or

#### Y = f(X 1 , X 2 )

```

```

#### Dependent variable Independent

#### variables

# A Generic Mathematical Model

```

```

## Y = f(X 1 , X 2 ,...,Xn)

#### Y = dependent variable

#### (aka bottom-line performance measure)

#### Xi = independent variables

#### (inputs having an impact on Y)

#### f(.) = function defining the relationship between Y & Xi

#### Where: Y is DEPENDENT for the variable of X_i

# Mathematical Models & Spreadsheets

▪ Most spreadsheet models are very similar to our generic
mathematical model:

```

```

# Y = f(X 1 , X 2 , ..., Xn)

```
▪ Most spreadsheets have input cells (representing Xi) to which
mathematical functions ( f(.)) are applied to compute a
bottom-line performance measure (or Y).
```

# How to Use a Model

```
▪ Don’t accept an answer without further analysis and
questioning.
▪ A mathematical model is only one of a number of tools for
decision making.
▪ If the answer is unacceptable, the reasons for unacceptability
should be spelled out and incorporated in a modified model.
▪ An acceptable answer is only an option.
▪ By successive questioning of the answers and altering the
model, it is possible to clarify the options available and obtain a
greater understanding of what is possible in a real situation.

# Psychology of Decision Making

▪ Models can be used for structural aspects of decision
problems.
▪ Other aspects cannot be structured easily, requiring intuition
and judgment.
▪ Caution: Human judgment and intuition are not always rational!
▪ Errors in human judgment often arise because of anchoring
and framing effects associated with decision problems.

```

```

# Framing Effects

▪ Refers to how decision-makers view a problem from a win-loss
perspective.

▪ The way a problem is framed often influences choices in
irrational ways...

```

```

看似不同，其實一樣

# Framing Effects 2

# DARK PATTERNS ！

Which option would you select?

```
This food is 95% fat free
vs
This food consists of 5% fat
```

You generally obtain different answers from the same person.

```

```

# Good Decisions vs. Good Outcomes

▪ Good decisions do not always lead to good outcomes...

```

```

- A structured, modelling approach to decision making helps us
    make good decisions, but can’t guarantee good outcomes.

What is a good decision?
A balance among

- What we know- What we can do
- What we want

```
Discuss the characteristics of optimisation problems
```

Explore the use of linear programming (LP) in solving
optimisationproblems
```

```
Solving LP problems using graphical approach
```

# Introduction

▪ We all face decision about how to use limited resources such
as:

- Oil in the earth
- Land for dumps
- Time
- Money
- Workers

```

```

# Mathematical Programming...

▪ A field of management science that finds the optimal, or most
efficient, way of using limited resources to achieve the
objectives of an individual of a business.
▪ _Also referred to as ..._ Optimisation

```

```

# Applications of Optimization

```

```

- Determining Product Mix
  - How many of each product to produce to maximise profits
     or to satisfy demand at minimum cost?
- Manufacturing
  - Eg. For a circuit board, what is the drilling order that
     minimises total distance the drill bit must be moved?
- Routing and Logistics
  - What is the least costly method of transferring goods from
     warehouses to stores?
- Financial Planning
  - How much to save in superannuation to minimise tax
     liability?

# Characteristics of Optimization Problems

▪ Decisions

- One or more decisions that must be made

▪ Constraints

- Due to limited resources

▪ Objectives

- Goal that decision maker considers when making decision
- To maximise profit or minimise cost

```

```

## General Form of an Optimization Problem

```
MAX (or MIN): f 0 (X 1 , X 2 , ..., Xn)
```

```
Subject to: f 1 (X 1 , X 2 , ..., Xn) <= b 1
:
fk(X 1 , X 2 , ..., Xn) >= bk
:
fm(X 1 , X 2 , ..., Xn) = bm
```

```
Note: If all the functions in an optimization are linear, the problem
is a Linear Programming (LP) problem

# Linear Programming (LP) Problems

MAX (or MIN): c 1 X 1 + c 2 X 2 + ... + cnXn

Subject to: a 11 X 1 + a 12 X 2 + ... + a 1 nXn <= b 1
:
ak 1 X 1 + ak 2 X 2 + ... + aknXn >=bk
:
am 1 X 1 + am 2 X 2 + ... + amnXn = bm

```

```

# An Example LP Problem

```

```

#### Blue Ridge Hot Tubs produces two types of hot tubs:

#### Aqua-Spas & Hydro-Luxes.

#### There are 200 pumps, 1566 hours of labor, and

#### 2880 feet of tubing available.

#### Aqua-Spa Hydro-Lux

#### Pumps 1 1

#### Labor 9 hours 6 hours

#### Tubing 12 feet 16 feet

#### Unit Profit $350 $300

```
Decision: Hw many Aqua-Spa and Hydro-Luxcan be produced
```

# 5 Steps In Formulating LP Models:

1. Understand the problem.
2. Identify the decision variables.
    X 1 =number of Aqua-Spas to produce
    X 2 =number of Hydro-Luxes to produce
3. State the objective function as a linear combination of the
    decision variables.
   
       MAX: 350X 1 + 300X 2

```

```

# 5 Steps In Formulating LP Models

# (continued)

4. State the constraints as linear combinations of the decision
    variables.
   
       1X 1 + 1X 2 <= 200 } pumps
       9X 1 + 6X 2 <= 1566 } labor
       12X 1 + 16X 2 <= 2880 } tubing
5. Identify any upper or lower bounds on the decision variables.
    X 1 >= 0
    X 2 >= 0

```

```

# LP Model for

# Blue Ridge Hot Tubs

## MAX: 350X 1 + 300X 2

## S.T.: 1X 1 + 1X 2 <= 200

## 9X 1 + 6X 2 <= 1566

## 12X 1 + 16X 2 <= 2880

## X 1 >= 0

## X 2 >= 0

## Solving LP Problems: An Intuitive Approach

▪ Idea: Each Aqua-Spa (X 1 ) generates the highest unit profit ($350), so
let’s make as many of them as possible!
▪ How many would that be?

- Let X 2 = 0
  - 1st constraint: 1X 1 <= 200
  - 2nd constraint: 9X 1 <=1566 or X 1 <=174
  - 3rd constraint: 12X 1 <= 2880 or X 1 <= 240

▪ If X 2 =0, the maximum amount of X 1 you could make is 174 and the
total profit is $350*174 + $300*0 = $60,900
▪ This solution is feasible, but is it optimal?
▪ No! 39

## Solving LP Problems: A Graphical

## Approach

▪ The constraints of an LP problem defines its feasible region.
▪ The best point in the feasible region is the optimal solution to
the problem.
▪ For LP problems with 2 variables, it is easy to plot the
feasible region and find the optimal solution.

## Calculating the Optimal Solution

▪ The optimal solution occurs where the “pumps” and “labor”
constraints intersect.
▪ This occurs where:
X 1 + X 2 = 200 (1)
and 9X 1 + 6X 2 = 1566 (2)
▪ From (1) we have, X 2 = 200 -X 1 (3)
▪ Substituting (3) for X 2 in (2) we have,
9X 1 + 6 (200 -X 1 ) = 1566
→ X 1 = 122
▪ So the optimal solution is:
Substituting X 1 =122 in X 2 = 200 – X 1 → X 2 = 78
Total Profit = $350*122 + $300*78 = $66,100 47
