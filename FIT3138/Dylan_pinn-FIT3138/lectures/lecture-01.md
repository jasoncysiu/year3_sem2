# Lecture 1: Introduction to Real-Time Enterprise Systems

## Learning Objectives

- Explain terminology specific to Enterprise Systems.
- Identify Enterprise system drivers.
- Explain Enterprise system beliefs.
- Discuss how technological advancement forge the way for real-time enterprise systems in support of current market behaviours of "Online connectivity, real-time response and in-context performance".
- Discuss the framework for harnessing Real-time Enterprise ---
  "Sense-Analyse-Response".
- Describe characteristics of real-time Enterprise systems.

## Why Study Enterprise Systems

Because they have:

- Affected most major corporations
- Affected competitor behaviour
- Affected business partners' requirements
- Changed the nature of consulting firms
- A tool for reengineering
- Diffused many"best practices"
- Changed the nature of information systems functionality.
- Changed teh nature of jobs in all functional areas
- Basis for eBusiness
- Caused some serious cost blow outs
- Costly to implement
- Poor benefit realisation after go live

## What is a System

Data input -> Process data -> Meaningful output

## What is an enterprise system?

- An Enterprise System can be defined as “an enterprise-wide, modular,
  integrated, real time information system responsible for transaction
  processing across all business areas of the organisation”
- It is made up of a series of “modules”, or applications that are seamlessly
  linked together through a common database, an ERP system enables various departments or operating units such as Accounting and Finance, Human Resources, Production, and sales and Distribution to coordinate activities, share information, and collaborate with customers, vendors etc

## What is "Real-time Enterprise"?

> “...transactions are executed by straight through processing; information is captured at point of origin through reality online; and databases are updated continuously, shared and mined in ways that makes their content more meaningful and more actionable.” (Chorafas, D.N. The Real-Time Enterprise)

Key Enterprise System Characteristics

- Links all business processes automatically

- Utilises best business process practices

- Reduces inter-processing time

  - transactions occur one time at the source

- Maintains an audit trail of all transactions

- Utilises a common database for

  - Master data
  - Transactional data
  - Enabling BI

- Performs internal conversions automatically (tax, foreign currency, legal
  rules for payroll)

- Uses current technology

## What does an enterprise system do?

- Brings together previously isolated information systems with the goal of
  providing a more whole or complete information resource.

- This integration includes bringing together:

  - People
  - Processes
  - Information
  - Systems

- To achieve a common strategic business goal.

## The case for enterprise integration

- Integrated enterprise systems are often achieved using ERP software.

- Originally systems very often worked in silos:

  - No connection with other systems in the organisation (isolated)
  - No sharing of data (isolated data)
  - Management had difficulty obtaining accurate data in a timely and efficient manner.
  - Too many legacy systems --- getting too old to funciton effectively and not economically viable to maintain.
  - Not able to keep up with their competitors/rivals in the market place.
  - Not agile enough to change direction.
  - Economic downturn.

## Why do organisation adopt Enterprise systems?

- Technology Rationales

  - Year 2000
  - Disparate Systems
  - Poor existing systems
  - Difficult to integrate acquisitions
  - Common platform and data transparency

- Business Process Rationales

  - Personnel reduction
  - IT cost reduction
  - Productivity improvements
  - Financial cycle close
  - Revenue

- Strategic Rationales

  - Added functionality
  - eBusiness
  - Response to mergers etc.

- Competitive Rationales

  - Competitive pressures to become a low cost producer.

## Key Benefits for a company deciding to implement an enterprise system?

- Enhance all aspects of key operations across a company's entire back-office -

  - from planning through execution, management, and control.
  - They accomplish this by taking processes and functions that were previously disparate and disjointed, and seamlessly integrating and coordinating them.

- Facilitate more efficient completion of day-to-day tasks.

- Reduce the redundant and overlapping activities that waste time and money by standardising core procedures.

- Eliminate data silos by creating a single, centralised repository of timely,
  accurate business data.

- Enable more effective resource allocation and management.

## Technology and the Real-time

- Real-Time computing was applied to Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS) in most aerospace, medical or automotive industries.
- Real-Time now has started to extend into the realm of applications, middleware and even business processes.
- Businesses now need to have a clear understanding of the most effective way to leverage technology to compete in the current market which is characterised by
  "Online connectivity, real-time response and in-context performance."
- Today's businesses need to extend their focus to protect their revenues and to
  differentiate themselves
- "...to build-operate-transform businesses to real-time enterprises which would
  connect customers, partners, suppliers and employees with real-time business
  processes and emerging technologies to provide forbetter integration,
  interaction and agility."

## Framework for harnessing Real-time Enterprise

Enterprises need to have a 3-step framework:

- Sense
- Analyse
- Respond

## What is Sense-Analysis-Response?

- "Sense" component that enables the enterprise to be informed of all external
  and internal information that is relevant;
- "Analyse" component that helps analyse the information, identify patterns,
  forecast and predict likely impacts and consequences;
- "Respond" component that determines the best possible response based on the analysis of the relevant information and executes the determined response.

## Characteristics of Real-time Enterprise

- Agility
- Available anywhere anytime
- Scalable
- Intelligent
- Collaboration Driven
- Low Latency
