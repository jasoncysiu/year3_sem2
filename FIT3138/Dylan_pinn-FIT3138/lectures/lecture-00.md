# Lecture 0: Introduction to FIT3138

## Overview

- Theoretical and practical overview of real time enterprise systems.
- Real time enterprise systems are configurable information system packages,
  implemented on-line that integrate people, technology and information
  processing.

## Unit Objectives

On successful completion of this unit, students should be able to:

- describe the characteristics, features and functionality of a real time
  enterprise system, the major application modules, and major business
  processes, data integration points, and the importance of master data,
  reporting, configuration and security that distinguishes it from other
  software systems;
- explain the benefits of enterprise systems in terms of integration, world-wide
  flexibility, interactive processing, client-server platform, cloud computing,
  SOA, open systems, and the capacity to be configured for all business types;
- discuss implementation project team responsibilities, the importance of clear
  communication, people handling and team management skills that are required of an enterprise systems implementation/project manager using examples from actual business cases;
- critically discuss the major factors that impact on stakeholders during an
  enterprise system implementation that can influence the project triple
  constraints and business success identified from both theoretical knowledge
  and actual business cases;
- demonstrate a capacity to describe and perform navigation functions and create master data objects in an enterprise systems system;
- describe system-wide concepts such as workflow, reporting, and the exchange of information between business partners and employees;
- explain the stages of an enterprise systems implementation lifecycle with
  particular focus on continuous change with regard to enhancement packs,
  upgrades, and new versions.
