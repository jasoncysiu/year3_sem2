# Development of Enterprise Resource Planning Systems

## Objectives

- Identify the factors that led to the development of Enterprise Resource
  Planning (ERP) systems
- Describe the distinguishing modular characteristics of ERP software
- Discuss the pros and cons of implementing an ERP system
- Summarise ongoing developments in ERP

## Introduction

- Efficient, integrated information systems are very important for companies to
  be competitive.
- An Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system can help integrate a companies
  operations
  - Acts as a company-wide computing environment
  - Includes a database that is shared by all functional areas
  - Can deliver consistent data across all business functions in real time.

## The Evolution of Information Systems

**Silos**

- Information systems configuration used until recently
- Companies had unintegrated information systems that supported only the
  activities of individual business functional areas.

**Current ERP systems evolved as a result of**

- Advancement of hardware and software technology
- Development of a vision of integrated information systems
- Reengineering of companies to shift from a functional focus to a business
  process focus

## Management's impetus to Adopt ERP

- Hard economic times of the last 1980s and early 1990s caused many companies to
  downsize and reorganise.
  - Stimulus to ERP development
- Inefficiencies caused by the functional model of business organisation.
  - Silos of information
  - Limits the exchange of information between the lower operating levels.
- Functional model led to top-heavy and overstaffed organisations incapable of
  reacting quickly to change.
- Process business model
  - Information flows between the operating levels without top management's
    involvement.
- Further impetus for adopting ERP systems has come from compliance with the
  Sarbanes-Oxley ACT of 200
  - Requires companies to substantiate internal controls on all information.

## The Significance and Benefits of ERP Software and Systems

- More efficient business processes that cost less than those in unintegrated
  systems.
- Easier global integration.
- Integrates people and data while eliminating the need to update and repair
  many seperate computer systems.
- Allows management to manage operations, not just monitor them.
- Can dramatically reduce costs and improve operational efficiency

### How Much Does an ERP System Cost?

- Size of the ERP software
  - Corresponds to the size of the company it serves
- Need for new hardware that is capable of running complex ERP software
- Consultant's and analysts' fees
- Time for implementation
  - Causes distruption of business
- Training
  - Costs both time and money

### What Return can a Company expect from its ERP investment?

- ERP eliminates redundant efforts and duplicated data; can generate savings in
  operations expense.
- ERP system can help produce goods an services more quickly.
- Company that doesn't implement an ERP system might be forced out of business
  by competitors that have an ERP system.
- Smoothly running ERP system can save a company's personnel, suppliers,
  distributors, and customers much frustration.
- Cost savings and increased revenues occur over many years
  - Difficult to put an exact dollar figure to the amount accrured from the
    original ERP investment.
- ERP implementations take time
  - Other business factors may be affecting the company's costs and
    profitability.
  - Difficult to isolate the impact of the ERP system alone.
- ERP systems provide real-time data
  - Improve external customer communications.

### How Long Does it Take to See a Return on an ERP Investment?

- **Return on investment (ROI)**: assessment of an investment project's value
  - Calculated by dividing the value of the project's benefits by the project's
    cost.
- ERRP system's ROI can be difficult to calculate
- Peerstone Research study
  - 63 percent of companies that performed the calculation reported a positive
    ROI for ERP.
  - Most companies felt that non-financial goals were the reason behind their
    ERP installations.

### Why Do Some Companies Have More Success with ERP that Others?

- Usually, a bumpy rollout and low ROI are caused by _people_ problems and
  misguided expectations, not computer malfunctions:
  - Executives blindly hoping that new software will cure fundamental business
    problems that are not curable by any software.
  - Executives and IT managers not taking enough time for a proper analysis
    during planning and implementation phase.
  - Executives and IT managers skimping on employee education and training.
  - Companies not placing ownership or accountability for the implementation
    project on the personnel who will operate the system.
  - Unless a large project such as an ERP installation is promoted from the top
    down, it is doomed to fail.
  - ERP implementation brings a tremendous amount of change for users.
- For many users, it takes years before they can take advantage of many of an
  ERP system's capabilities.
- Most ERP installations do generate returns.

## Summary

- Speed an power of computing hardware increased exponentially, while cost and
  size decreased.
- Early client-server architecture provided the conceptual framework for
  multiple users sharing common data.
- Increasingly sophisticated software facilitated integration, especially in two
  areas: A/F and manufacturing resource planning.
- Growth of business size, complexity, and competition made business managers
  demand more efficient and competitive information systems.
- SAP AG produced a complex, modular ERP program called R/3
  - Could integrate a companies entire business by using a common database that
    linked all operations.
