## Top 5 keys to successful ERP Implementation

1. Clear alignment with overall business strategy
2. Realistic expectations during implementation..
3. Laser focus on people, organisational change management and workflow
   transition.
4. Effective business process management and process improvement.
5. Strong project management, governance and controls.

## Case Study - Identify Critical Risks form a failed IT project

RMIT - Project - 2001 - Just a small financial loss!!

- The Victorian Auditor-General's Office slammed RMIT University's management
  over their bungled Academic Management System (AMS) IT project, identifying
  "fundamental failures" in project management structures.
- The AMS , which "went live" in October 2001, was supposed to **_streamline
  processes_** by consolidating all of RMIT's student management activities, but
  instead cost the university more than AU\$47 million, a figure equal to 3.7
  times the original budget, according to the report.
- Project Commenced Dec 1999
- Objective:
  - Replace existing student administration management systems
- Aim:
  - Integrate all RMIT' student management activities into a single consolidated
    system using PeopleSoft software whilst exploiting internet technologies to
    streamline processes.
- Decision to use PeopleSoft:
  - PeopleSoft could provide a single, integrated software platform as opposed
    to multiple systems.
- Go Live: Oct 2001
- Anticipated cost savings
  - Expected savings \$10m per year
  - Actual - Lost \$47m
- Since going live
  - Difficulties in billing fee paying students
  - Difficulties in issuing HECS statements
  - Delays in processing and advising students
  - Problems in meeting statutory/legal reporting
  - Shortcomings in hardware and software performance
- Organisational impact:
  - Contributed to weakened financial position of RMIT

### What went wrong

#### Systems Perspective

Key Findings:

- "go live date" to early
- Technology not robust
- Business processes were not suitably identified
- Roll-out of the system coincided with an administrative overhaul
  - Subject codes and student numbers were changed
  - Familiar conventions removed
- Mismatch between what was promised by vendors and what was delivered (Vendors
  oversold product)
- Ineffective documentation
- Need to modify the key proprietary component of the PeopleSoft system selected
  for the AMS
  - These systems are developed from best practices

#### Project Management Perspective

Key Findings:

- No project management methodology
  - PMBOK (Initiating, Planning, Executing, Controlling, Closing)
- Ineffective risk management
- Inadequate quality planning/management
- Inadequate project reporting
- Lack of stakeholder management
- Poor change management
- AMS project failure to internal culture

Key Audit Findings:

- Appeared to be no formal sign off of key project deliverables.
- Business requirements, specifications, testing, etc.
- No evidence of formal signoff of project functionality by stakeholders.

## Consequences of Project Failure

- Degrade business capacity
- Degrade competitive advantage
- Increase operating costs
- Reduce revenue earnings
- Failure to meet critical business requirements
- Poor levels of user satisfaction
  - Loss of staff
  - Staff will not use the system properly
- Loss of control

## Why IT Projects Fail - The Critical Factors

- Poor project planning
- A weak business case
- Lack of senior management involvement & support
- Lack of user involvement
- Technology new to the organisation
- Lack of business ownership
- Poor or ineffectual training
  - Train the trainer
  - Consultants

### 13 warnings signs that the ERP implementation project may be in trouble

1. Not reviewing the project with the executive team on at least a bin-monthly
   basis.
2. There is no dedicated project team.
3. There is no training scheduled until less than 90 days before go-live.
4. The organisational change management plan only consists of end-user training.
5. No contingency budget.
6. Don't have at least three iterations of conference room pilots or integration
   testing.
7. Budget assumes that software license costs are a majority of the total
   implementation costs.
8. Don't have a strong program management team with at least several dozen
   implantations collectively under the belt.
9. The software technies are running the project
10. Don't have a business case, performance metrics, or a benefits realisation
    plan.
11. The definition of success is: "Just get the damn thing up and running."
12. Have very little margin for error to miss customer shipments at go-live.
13. Will not customise the software, under any circumstances.

## Budget Overrun

Top 3 reasons for budget overruns:

- Unanticipated technical or organisational issues
- Initial project budget was not realistic
- The addition of technology requirements

## Project Duration Overruns

Based on Panorama Consulting 2018 survey:

- 79% of the respondents reported that their projects exceeded their initial
  timelines, an increase of 20% from last year.
- The average implementation duration was 17.4 months, compared to 16.9 months
  last year.

To mitigate the possibility of a schedule overrun:

- After the implementation has begun, it is still critical to look for warning
  signs of potential disruptions.
- Monitoring end-user and process owner involvement is critical throughout all
  stages of the project.
- Pro actively implementing training and other change management exercises.

## Project vs Project Management

A project is...

> "The achievement of a specific objective, involving a number of tasks and
> activities which consume resources.

> this objective is to be completed to a set specification and within a finite
> timescale."

Project management is ...

> "the process of controlling the achievement of the project objectives
> ...defining requirements and scope ...allocating resources ...monitoring
> progress ...managing deviations when necessary."

### Successful

Projects

- Delivery functionality & usability to users
- Achieve business and strategic goals
- Realise financial benefits
- Satisfy business stakeholders

Project Management

- Completes project within budget, on time and within scope.
- Provides project with appropriate quality standards and scope (PMBOK).

## Top Reasons for ERP Failures

- Lack of purpose for implementing ERP
- Not going into the project with the 'eyes wide open'
- Lack of executive and management buy-in
- Not leveraging the "A-Team" from the business
- Not choosing software that aligned with the business and key requirements
- Misalignment between software configuration and business processes/workflows
- Lack of effective OCM and training
- Weak internal and external project management
- Underdeveloped business case to manage business benefits.

## Project Risks arise from

- The nature of the technology used ('cutting edge', or 'established')
- The number of stakeholders and their experience/understanding and stability.
- The experience (or inexperience) of the project team
- The duration of the project
- Size of the project team
- Skill of the project team
- Effects of other projects
- Other commitments on the project group
- Level of management support
- Inability to manage scope creep

Risks should be "owned" by the project and stakeholders by acceptance of the
business case.

Risk management requires support and communication between stakeholders.

### Risks and Project Management

- Risks are the consequence of uncertainty
- Project risks = Event \* probability of the event occurring \* consequences of
  the event.
- Risk is a combination of the probability of a negative event occurring and its
  consequences.
- A risk needs to be measurable
- A risk needs to be identifiable
- In a project a risk may be identified as:
  - Lack of skilled consultant in logistics
  - Implementation guidelines not clearly communicated
- Generically, a risk is "the possibility of loss or injury"
- In an IT project a risk is any event that may jeopardise satisfying the
  objectives of the project.
- For IT projects, risk management can provide opportunities for a better
  understanding of the project.
- Risks need to be identified and managed
- Risk management should be ongoing and pro-active

## Risk Management

Risk management is defined as...

- "the process of understanding and managing the risks that the organisation is
  inevitably subject to in attempting to achieve its corporate objectives"

A more integrated approach to risk management

- Risk management has transformed from a 'department focused' approach to a
  holistic, co-ordinated and integrated process which manages risk throughout
  the organisation.
- Enterprise Risk Management is the term given to the alignment of risk
  management with business strategy and the embedding of a risk management
  culture into business operations.

### Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)

- Enterprise Risk Management (ERM
  - Defined as: _"A process, effected by an entity's board of directors,
    management and other personnel, applied in strategy setting and across the
    enterprise, designed to identify potential events that may effect the
    entity, and manage risk to be within its risk appetite, to provide
    reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of entity objectives."_ COSO
    (2003)
- Benefits of Effective ERM
  - Enhanced decision-making by integrating risks
  - The resultant improvement in investor confidence and hence shareholder value
  - Focus of management attention on the most significant risks
  - A common language of risk management which is understood throughout the
    organisation
  - Reduced cost of finance through effective management of risk

## Risk Management Process

1. Risk Assessment
   - The analysis and evaluation of risk through the process of identification,
     description and estimation to assess their potential consequences.
   - Identifying project risks
     - Based on previous (historical) experience with similar projects
     - Develop a list of risk factors and weight according to their potential
       impact
     - Highest risk is at the outset of the project
2. Risk Response
   - Plan responses to minimise the risks
     - Contingency plans
3. Risk Monitoring
   - Monitor how well the risks are mitigated and managed
     - Adopt appropriate tools

### Risk Assessment

- Risk assessment is the most difficult phase
- Risk is based on uncertainty and constraint of the project requirements
  - Uncertainty - politics
- Some constraints will be difficult to evaluate and remove
  - Culture
  - Work team environment
  - Manpower
  - Availability of skilled staff

#### The Risk Register

- What is a 'Risk Register'
  - An important and practical risk management tool
  - Record risks identified in the Risk Identification process
- Laid out in tabular format with various headings:
  - Risk title
  - Likelihood of risk (1 = unlikely, 5 = highly likely)
  - Risk owners
  - Date - when risk was identified
  - Mitigation actions
  - Overall risk rating (1 - 10)
  - Further action (if any)
  - "Action lead" - name of person responsible for action
  - Due date - for action to be implemented
  - Risk level target

#### 5 key takeaways about assessing risk in ERP Implementation Project

1. Seek out unbiased, independent third-party resources, to conduct a formalised
   risk assessment throughout your implementation.
2. Look at potential ERP implementation risks from all possible angles.
3. Assess project risk using the most common root causes of ERP failure.
4. Prioritise risks and identify risk mitigation plans.
5. Recognise early warning signs of ERP implementation risk.

### Risk Response Strategy

- The management of risks - to ensure that:
  - Exposure to severe risks is minimised
  - Unnecessary risks are avoided
  - Appropriate measures of control are taken
  - The balance between risk and return is appropriate
- Strategy
  - Transference/Sharing
  - Avoidance
  - Reduction/mitigation
  - Acceptance

#### Risk Mapping and Risk Responses\

### Risk Monitoring & Control

- It involves overseeing the effectiveness of risk responses, monitoring
  residual risks, identifying and documenting new risks, and assuring that risk
  management processes are followed.
- Risk control is conducted for all risks categorised as high risk high
  consequence (Medium risks are analysed separately)
- Owners should be assigned to major risks for monitoring
- This should be iterative process
- Controlling identified & evaluated risks
  - Actively seek to monitor the risk
    - Develop action plans
      - Set up warning systems
      - Report on status of risk
  - Develop contingency plans

## Cost of Fixing Project risks

- Money invested in reducing risk in the early stages of a project is money well
  invested.
- Any risks incurred during the project have to be diagnosed and fixed.
- Using risk control as an iterative process will help to manage major risks and
  thereby cut cost blowouts.
