## Introduction

- What is Change Management?

  > "Change management is an approach to transition individuals, teams, and
  > organisations to desire future state."

- How do we deal with change?

## What impede a successful outcome

- Lack of leadership support
- Lack of communication and support
- Lack of education and training
- Lack of change management strategy throughout the implementation
- Resistance to change by stakeholders
- Management do not support the implementation
- End-users not ready for the change
- Organisational readiness
- High turnover of key trained personnel
- Technological problems - configuration and modification difficulties
- Cultural issues
- Lack of user involvement

## Changes in ERP implementation - how to manage these

- Enterprise wide business process changes
- Job redesign/upskilling
- Reduction in head count
- Change in climate and culture
- Change in relationships - political and power structures
- Project team skills
- Consultant skills
- Training needs
- Managing risks

## Do People Fear Change?

- The pace of change has increased considerably - particularly with the advent
  of the Internet and the rapid deployment of new technologies and new ways of
  doing business.
- In general, people fear change.
- Organisational change management helps organisations empathise with employees'
  fears and provide them with ample information about project goals and ongoing
  progress.

## Managing Change

- Summation of responses identified the following best practices:
  - Keeping staff informed by communicating changes and the need for these
    changes.
  - Training staff before during and after implementation.
  - Using staff as expert users and trainers
    - Staff could relate to them - Train the trainer approach.
  - Training manuals which are easy to follow.
  - Users of the system form part of the process.
  - Employ a variety of change strategies.

## Key Training Issues

- Identify strategies to manage stakeholders.
  - Needs analysis/de-skilling/up-skilling
  - Appropriate trainers and training with appropriate documentation with
    ongoing support.
- Standardised training
  - Consultant attribute - Transfer of knowledge / Train the trainer.
  - Trainer attributes
- Training needs analysis
  - Identify training needs based on the business process changes to their job
    role and the amount of contact with the new system.
  - Identify different stakeholder requirements.
  - Analyse prospective attribute issues that could negatively impact on the
    implementation.
- Post implementation review based on business case outcomes (timings and
  expectations).

## Key points to note when managing change

- Keep explaining why we are changing
- Where possible, involve your team in decision making.
- Minimise uncertainty.
- Engage you legacy system & process experts early.
- Be as transparent as possible.
- Create learning opportunities for your team.
- Communicate the treat of not changing.
- Keep listening to your people's concerns.
- Celebrate shifts towards the desired state.

## Organisational Change Management Best Practices

1. Customise training and communications
   - Communications and training should be immediately applicable to your
     organisation's specific situation.
2. Assess change readiness
   - Measure and identify the root causes for organisational resistance.
   - Having a series of online surveys and focus groups to gauge employee
     acceptance and other organisational issues.
3. Convert process owners
   - Identify process devotees; individuals who have brought value on the
     processes they have developed.
   - Target them as early as possible to get their buy-in and support.
4. Top management buy-in and supervision
   - A changed process needs proper supervision and accountability
   - Buy-in must come from the top down.
   - Usage must be consistent and consistently enforced.
5. Don't sweat the small stuff
   - The technical issues are much easier to solve than the internal issues
     related to personnel and their on-the-job tasks.
   - Do not focus on the software at the expense of the people and the processes
     who will drive overall organisational success.

## Top 10 contributing factors to the failure of change management

1. An utter lack of plan to guide the change
2. Failure to define a clear rationale for the change
3. Ignoring culture
4. Weak follow through by sponsors
5. Not investing resources in the change effort
6. Gap in change agent skills
7. Haphazard communication
8. Fear of feedback
9. Declaring success too early
10. Neglecting to reinforce the change

## Kotter's 8 Step Process for Leading Change

1. Create a sense of urgency
   - Top leaders must describe an opportunity that will appeal to individuals'
     heads and hearts and use this statement to raise a large, urgent army of
     volunteers.
   - Identify, articulate and communicate the need for change.
2. Build a guiding coalition
   - A volunteer army needs a coalition of effective people - coming from its
     own ranks - to guide it, coordinate it and communicate its activities.
   - Put together a group of 3 - 5 to be change leaders
   - The group must trust each other and be moving in the same direction.
3. Form a strategic vision and initiatives
   - Dr. Kotter defines strategic initiatives as targeted and coordinated
     "activities that, if designed and executed fast enough and well enough,
     will make your vision a reality."
   - The better people can envision where they are going, the more they can
     focus on specific initiatives that will make that vision a reality.
4. Enlist a volunteer army
   - Large-scale change can only occur when very significant numbers of
     employees amass under a common opportunity and drive in the same direction.
   - Build excitement around the initiative and develop a feeling that one
     "Wants to" (not "has to") contribute.
5. Enable action by removing barriers
   - By removing barriers such as inefficient processes or hierarchies, leaders
     provide the freedom necessary for employees to work across boundaries and
     create real impact - empowering employees.
6. Generate short-term wins
   - Wins are the molecules of results. They must be collected, categories, and
     communicated - early and often - to track progress and energise your
     volunteers to drive change.
   - Generating and celebrating wins along the way is vital to acceleration
     towards and focus on the goal.
7. Sustain acceleration
   - Change leaders must adapt quickly in order to maintain their speed.
   - Set goals to continue building on the momentum.
8. Institute change
   - To ensure new behaviours are repeated over the long-term, it's important
     that to define and communicate the connections between these behaviours and
     the organisation's success.
   - Anchoring new approaches in the culture.

## Conclusion

- Change is pervasive in our society and a fact of life in organisations. Change
  management is about modifying or transforming organisations in order to
  maintain or improve their effectiveness.
- While organisation change management is a critical component of a successful
  ERP project, organisations spend too little time and money on activities that
  ensure maximum buy-in and benefits realisation.
- The impact of not devoting sufficient effort to these activities is profound,
  and must not be underestimated.
- Organisations must shift their focus away from the technical aspects of
  implementation and towards the things that really count: making sure end-users
  and stakeholders have taken personal responsibility for making the
  implementation a success.
