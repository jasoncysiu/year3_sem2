## Introduction

- Lean about the activities in the Accounting functional area.
- Accounting is tightly integrated with all other functional areas.
- Accounting activities are necessary for decision making.

## Accounting Activities

### Areas of accounting

- Financial accounting
- Managerial accounting

#### Financial accounting

- Documenting all transactions of a company that have an impact on the financial
  state of the firm.
- Using documented transactions to create reports for external parties and
  agencies.
- Reports, or financial statements, must allow prescribed rules and guidelines
  of various agencies.

#### Managerial accounting

- determining costs and profitability of company's activities.

### Financial Accounting

#### Common financial activities and statements

- Ensure accounts accurate and up-to-date.
- Making "Closing" entries and "Adjusting" entries.
- 2 Common financial reports: Balance sheets and Income statements.

##### Balance sheet

- Statement that shows account balances.
- Assets = Liabilities + Equity
  - Assets: Current assets: Cash, Accounts Receivable, Inventory
    - Long-term assets such as Building, Plant & Equipment, Land
  - Liabilities: Amounts owed to vendors, banks, and other creditors.
  - Equity: Amounts owners have invested in the company.

##### Income statement

- Profit and loss (P&L) statement
- Shows company's sales, cost of sales, and profit or loss for a period of time
  (typically a quarter or year).

### Managerial accounting

#### Determine costs and profitability of company's activities

- To develop long-term plans and strategy

#### Provide managers with detailed information

- To make informed decisions
- To create budgets
- To determine profitability

#### Information that managers use to control day-to-day activities

- To develop operational plans
- To handle different managerial issues

## Using ERP for Accounting Information

### Problems associated with unintegrated systems

- Data sharing usually did not occur in real-time
  - Accounting data were often out of date
- Accounting personnel had to do significant research
- In traditional accounting, company's accounts are kept in a record called a
  **general ledger**.

### Integrated ERP systems

- ERP system, with its centralised database, avoids these problems
- Simplifies process of closing books and preparing financial statements.
- In the SAP ERP system, different modules (such as SD, MM, PP, HR, AM) cause
  transaction data to be entered into the general ledger simultaneously as when
  the business transactions occur.

## Operational Decision-Making Problem

### Credit Management

#### Credit management requires a good balance between

- Granting sufficient credit to support sales; and
- Making sure that the company does not lose too much money.

#### What it involves?

- Setting a limit on how much a customer can owe at any one time
- Monitoring that limit as orders come in and payments are received

#### Require real-time information

- Sales representative needs to be able to review an up-to-date accounts
  receivable balance when an order comes in.

#### How an integrated ERP Systems help

- Accounts receivable is immediately updated

## Product Profitability Analysis

- Business managers use accounting data to perform profitability analyses of a
  company and its products.
- When data are inaccurate or incomplete, the analyses are flawed
- Main reasons for inaccurate or incomplete data
  - Inconsistent record keeping
  - Inaccurate inventory costing systems
  - Problems consolidating data from subsidiaries.

### Inconsistent record keeping

- Each marketing divisions maintains its own records and keeps track of sales
  data differently
- Paper records might be inaccurate or missing, making validity of the final
  report questionable.
- Withing integrated information systems, accounting and reporting to management
  requires:
  - Working around limitations of information systems to produce useful output
- ERP system minimises or eliminates these problems.

### Inaccurate Inventory Costing Systems

#### Calculating inventory costs

- One of the most important and challenging accounting tasks in any
  manufacturing company.

#### ERP and inventory cost accounting

- Many companies with unintegrated accounting systems analyse their cost
  variances infrequently
- Often, they do now know how much it actually costs to produce a unit of
  product.
- With an ERP system, employees throughout the company would have recorded costs
  in a company-wide database as they occurred.
- ERP system configurations allow analysts to track costs using many bases.

#### ERP and Activity-based costing

- Accountants identify activities associated with overhead cost generation and
  then keep records on costs and on activities.
- ABC requires more bookkeeping than traditional costing methods.

### Inventory Cost Accounting

#### Manufactured item's cost has three elements

- Cost of materials
- Cost of labor employed directly in production of item
- **Overhead:** all other costs

#### Direct costs: Material and labor

- Can be estimated fairly accurately

#### Indirect costs: Overhead items

- Difficult to associate with specific product(s)

#### Standard costs for a product are established by

- Studying historical direct and indirect cost patterns
- Taking into account the effects of current manufacturing changes
- **Cost variances**: differences between actual costs and standard costs.

### Consolidating Data form Subsidiaries

- Account balances for each entity must be compiled and forwarded to the home
  office.
- Consolidated statement for the company as a whole must be created
- Currency translation
  - Problems when **currency translation** is needed for a subsidiary's
    accounts.
- Inter-company transactions
  - Transactions that occur between companies and their subsidiaries

### Management Reporting with ERP Systems

- Generating the right reports for the right situation is often challenging
- Without an ERP system, the job of tracking all the numbers that need to go
  into a report is a monumental undertaking
- With ERP system, vast amount of information is available for reporting
  purposes

### Document Flow for Customer Service

- With an ERP system, all transactions in all areas of a company get posted in a
  centralised database
- Each transaction posted in SAP ERP gets its own unique document number
  - Allows quick access to the data
- In SAP ERP, document numbers for related transactions are associated in the
  database
  - Provides an electronic audit trail

### Built-In Management-Reporting and Analysis Tools

#### Maintenance of Accounting Records

- Accounting records maintained in the common database

#### Advantage of using an integrated database

- Provides the ability to query the records to:
  - Produce the standard reports
  - Answer ad hoc questions

#### Data Warehouse

- SAP provides a data warehouse within each major module
- Data warehouse: repository for data from various sources

## The Enron Collapse

### Some History

October 16, 2001: Enron was one the world's largest electricity and natural gas
traders

- Reported a \$618 million third-quarter loss and disclosed a \$1.2 billion
  reduction in shareholder equity.

US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) inquiry into possible conflict of
interest related to company's dealings with partnerships run by CFO Fastow.

- Volume of financial contracts was far greater than volume of contracts to
  actual deliver commodities
- Some partnerships were faked to mask billions of dollars in debt
- Enron's financial statements had been audited by Arthur Andersen, a highly
  regarded accounting firm
- Andersen employees on the Enron engagement team were instructed to destroy
  documentation relating to Enron.

### Outcome of the Enron Scandal

- Shareholders lost an estimated \$40 billion dollars
- Thousands of workers lost their jobs
- 31 individuals were either charged or pled guilty to criminal charges
- Jurors convicted accounting firm Arthur Andersen for obstructing justice by
  destroying Enron documents
- US Congress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
  - Act was designed to prevent the fraud and abuse that led to the Enron
    downfall.

### Key Features of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act

Designed to encourage top management accountability in firms that are publicly
traded in the United States

Title 11

: Auditor independence; Limits non-audit services that an auditor can provide

Title IV

: More stringent requirements for financial reporting

Title IX

: Financial statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission must
include a statement signed by the chief executive office and chief financial
officer, certifying that the financial statement complies with SEC rules

### Implications of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for ERP Systems

- To meet the internal control report requirements, a company must:
  - Document the controls that are in place
  - Verify that the controls are not subjected to error or manipulation
- Companies with ERP systems in place will have an easier time complying with
  the Sarbanes-Oxley Act that will companies without ERP.

## Archiving

- SAP ERP software offers very few ways to delete items
- Data are removed from SAP ERP system only after they have been recorded to
  media (tape backup, DVD-R) for permanent storage
- **Archive**: permanent storage
- SAP ERP systems keep track of when data are created or changed
  - Change Record

## User Authorisations

- SAP ERP has sophisticated user administration tools that allow different
  levels of authorisation management
  - Ensure that employees can perform only the transactions required for their
    jobs
- Profile Generator
  - Provides a simple method for selecting functions that a user should be
    allowed to perform.

## Tolerance Groups

- Setting limits on the size of transaction that an employee can process
  - In a SAP ERP system, this is done using tolerance groups
- Tolerance groups
  - Preset limits on an employee's ability to post transactions
  - Set limits on the dollar value for a single item in a document as well as
    the total value of document

## Financial Transparency

- ERP systems provide the ability to drill down form a report to the source
  documents (transactions) that created it.
  - Makes it easier for auditors to confirm the integrity of reports
- With a properly configured and managed ERP system, there are direct links
  between the company's financial statements and individual transactions that
  make up the statements
  - Fraud and abuse can be detected more easily

## Trends in Financial Reporting (XBRL)

- Extensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL)
  - Standards based language
  - Extensible Markup Language (XML) coded data directly from web page into
    database
  - Reports processed faster and validated easier
  - ERP systems accept data in XML and XBRL

## Summary

- Companies need accounting systems to record transactions and generate
  financial statements
- Unintegrated information systems
  - Accounting data might not be current
    - Can cause problems for sales representatives trying to make operational
      decisions

  - Can lead to more accurate product cost calculations
  - Can help managers determine which products are profitable and which are not
- Use of an integrated system and a common database to record accounting data
  has important management-reporting benefits

- Sarbanes-Oxley Act, 2002 US federal regulation
  - Written and passed in the wake of Enron collapse
  - Promoted management accountability by requiring extra financial approval and
    reporting
  - ERP systems can help companies meet the requirements of this legislation
- Trends in financial reporting
  - XBRL
  - XML
