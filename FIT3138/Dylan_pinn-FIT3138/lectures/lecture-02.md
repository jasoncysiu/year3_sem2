# Lecture 2: The Role of ERP in Business Functions and Processes

## Objectives

After completing, you will be able to:

- Name the main functional areas of operation used in business
- Differentiate between a business process and a business function.
- Identify the kinds of data each main functional area produces
- Identify the kinds of data each main functional area needs
- Define integrated information systems, and explain whey they are essential in
  today's globally competitive business environment.

## Introduction

Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)programs:

- Core software used by companies to coordinate information in every area of
  business

  - Help manage companywide business processes
  - Use common database and shared management reporting tools

Business process:

- Collection of activities that takes some input and creates an output that is
  of value to the customer.

## Functional Areas and Business Processes

- To understand ERP, you must understand how a business works

  - Functional areas of operation
  - Business processes

### Functional Areas of Operation

- Marketing and Sales (M/S)

- Supply Chain Management (SCM)

- Accounting and Finance (A/F)

- Human Resources (HR) Business functions: Activities specific to a functional
  area of operation.

- Functional areas are interdependent

  - Each requires data from others

- Better integration of functional areas leads to improvements in communication, workflow, and success of company.

- Information system (IS):Computers, people, procedures, and software that
  store, organise, and deliver information.

### Business Processes

- Collection of activities that takes on or more kinds of input and creates an
  output that is of value to customer

  - Customer can be traditional external customer or internal customer

- Thinking in terms of business processes helps managers to look at their
  organisation from the customer's perspective.

- Businesses must always consider customer's viewpoint in any transaction

- Successful customer interaction

  - Customer (either internal or external) is not required to interact with each
    business function involved in the process

- Successful business managers view business operations from the perspective of a satisfied customer.

- Sharing data effectively and efficiently between and within functional areas
  leads to more efficient business processes

- Integrated information systems:Systems in which functional areas share data

- Businesses take inputs (resources) and transform these inputs into goods and services for customers

  - Inputs: Material, people, equipment

- Managing inputs and business processes effectively requires accurate and
  up-to-date information.

## Functional Areas and Business Processes of a very small business

- Example: A fictitious coffee shop

  - Examine business processes of the coffee shop
  - See why coordination of functional areas help achieve efficient and effective business processes
  - Look at how integration of the information system improves the business.

### Marketing and Sales

- Functions of Marketing and Sales

  - Developing products
  - Determining pricing
  - Promoting products to customers
  - Taking customers' orders
  - Helping create a sales forecast

- Marketing and Sales tasks for the coffee shop

  - Formal recordkeeping not required

  - Need to keep track of customers

  - Product development can be done informally

  - Good repeat customers allow to charge purchases --- up to a point

    - Records must show how much each customer owes and his or her available credit.

### Supply Chain Management

- Functions within Supply Chain Management

  - Making the coffee (manufacturing/production)
  - Buying raw materials (purchasing)

- Production planning requires sales forecasts from M/S functional area

  - Sales forecasts: Analyses that attempt to predict the future sales.

- Production plans used to develop requirements for raw materials and packaging

  - Raw materials: bottled spring water, fresh lemons, artificial sweetener, raw sugar.
  - Packaging: Cups, straws, napkins

- SCM and M/S must choose a recipe for each coffee product sold

### Accounting and Finance

- Functions within Accounting and Finance

  - Recording raw data about transactions (including sales), raw material
    purchases, payroll, and receipt of cash from customers.

- Raw data:Numbers collected from sales, manufacturing and other operations,
  without any implementation, calculation, or arrangement for presentation.

- Data from Accounting and Finance used by Marking and Sales and SCM

  - Sales records are important component of sales forecast
  - Sales forecast is used in making staffing decisions and in production
    planning
  - Records from accounts receivable used to monitor the overall credit-granting policy of the coffee shop

### Human Resources

- Functions of HR

  - Recruit, train, evaluate, and compensate employees

- HR uses sales forecasts developed by the individual departments to plan
  personnel needs

- Systems integrated using ERP software provide the data sharing necessary
  between functional areas

## Functional Area Information Systems

- Potential inputs and outputs for each functional area described
- Information systems maintain relationships between all functional areas and
  processes

### Marketing and Sales

- Needs information from all functional areas

- Customers communicate areas to M/S in person or by telephone, e-mail, fax, the Web, etc.

- M/S has a role in determining product prices

  - Inventory levels can be kept low, saving money.

- SCM data and records can:

  - Provide data needed by A/F to determine how much of each resource was used

  promoting, and terminating employees

- Inputs for HR

  - Personnel forecasts
  - Skills data

- Outputs for HR

  - Regulation compliance
  - Employee training and certification
  - Skills database
  - Employee evaluation and compensation

- Significant amount of data is maintained by and shared among the functional
  areas

- Timeliness and accuracy of these data critical to each area's success and to
  company's ability to make a profit and generate future growth

- ERP software allows all functional areas to share a common database

  - Allows accurate, real-time information to be available

## Summary

- Basic functional areas: Marketing and Sales, Supply Chain Management,
  Accounting and Finance, and Human Resources.

- Marketing and Sales: Sets product prices, promotes products through
  advertising and marketing, takes customer orders, supports customers, and
  creates sales forecasts.

- Supply Chain Management: Develops production plans, orders raw materials from suppliers, receives raw material, manufactures products, maintains facilities, and ships products to customers.

- Accounting and Finance: Financial accounting to provide summaries of
  operational data in managerial reports, controlling accounts, planning and
  budgeting, and cash-flow management.

- Human Resourcing: Recruits, hires, trains, and compensates employees, ensures compliance with government regulations, and oversees the evaluation of employees

- Information systems capture, process, and store data to provide information
  needed for decision making.

- Employees working in one functional area need data from employees in other functional areas

  - Functional area information systems should be integrated, so shared data are accurate and timely

- Managers think in terms of business processes that integrate the functional
  areas

  - Need to share information between functions and functional areas
  - ERP software provides this capability by means of a single common database.
